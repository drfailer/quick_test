# quick_test

Extremely simple unittest library for c++. The purpose was just to play with
macros.

## Features

The purpose is to use macros for everything.

- `ASSERT` and `ASSERT_AQL` macros
- possibility to create tests group
- possibility to create tests functions

Note: a group inside a function will be treated as one test in the function.
